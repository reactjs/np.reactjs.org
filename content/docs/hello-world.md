एउटा सजिलो र साधारण react मा बनेको एप्प येस्तो देखिन्छ:

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

येसले पेजमा "Hello World" लेखिएको शिर्षक देखाउने छ।

[](codepen://hello-world)

माथि दिएको लिंकमा जानु भयो भने नया अनलाइन एडिटर खुल्छ त्यसमा तपाइले माथिको उदहारण देख्न सक्नुने छ।  त्यहाँ हजुरले कोड परिबर्तन गरेर के  हुदो रैछ भनेर नि हेर्न सक्नुने छ।  आफैले यता उता चलाउदा धेरै सिक्न पनि सकिन्छ। येहा र अब आउने पेजमा तपाइले येस्तै कोड एडिटर देख्नुने छ जसमा तपाइले परिबर्तन गरेर हेर्न सक्नुने छ। 

## How to Read This Guide {#how-to-read-this-guide}

In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

>Tip
>
>This guide is designed for people who prefer **learning concepts step by step**. If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our [practical tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.html). You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.

This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you're reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.

Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. **You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.** For example, [“Introducing JSX”](/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is the next chapter after this one.

## Knowledge Level Assumptions {#knowledge-level-assumptions}

React is a JavaScript library, and so we'll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. **If you don't feel very confident, we recommend [going through a JavaScript tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) to check your knowledge level** and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won't have to feel like you're learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.

>Note
>
>This guide occasionally uses some of the newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven't worked with JavaScript in the last few years, [these three points](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c) should get you most of the way.
